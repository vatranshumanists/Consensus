# Consensus
This is the repository for the Consensus proposal.

The consensus project aims to add new digital capabilities that were not possible during the republics original creation.  Consensus would be a digital opinion aggregation system, which works in parallel with the existing representation and public voting systems.  Consensus would not simply be a digital voting system in that it would support scaled responses as well as binary yes no votes and alternative proposal URI ingestion.
