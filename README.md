The American Democracy was created over 200 years ago without any consideration for the potential for individual participation that the current digital revolution provides.  This proposal is to fix that by adding a new digital tool called “Consensus”, to the American Government that allows the collection of personal opinion and judgment to be incorporated into the daily governance of the republic.  The tool will allow for the regular instantaneous collection and analysis.  It is acknowledged that there are many potential problems with such a system and the formal proposal attempts to deal with those in detail.
